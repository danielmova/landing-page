# The Odin Project - Flexbox Project

## The Flexbox Adventure (AKA: How to flex yourself to death)

Okay, so this Flexbox project? Man, it was a ride. I took, like, a whole month off from The Odin Project, and when I came back, my CSS file on my brain was totally blank. Like, completely wiped.

I was kinda freaking out, not gonna lie. But I was determined to get this done. So, I basically speedran the css and flexbox module again, and that "Interneting is Hard" flexbox tutorial? Lifesaver! Seriously, it got me back on track.

I got through it, but I'm thinking I should've used some real-world data. It would've been way more interesting.

## What I Learned (The Hard Way)

* Taking a month off? Not the best idea. My brain totally forgot everything.
* Speedrunning like a form to study? What a pain.
* Real data = way more fun.
